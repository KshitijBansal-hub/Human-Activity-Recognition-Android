# Human-Activity-Recognition

This is an Android application which tracks the user's acitivty and then classifies them.
The dataset is first collected using a smartphone's accelerometer.
In this application, we are going to track 3 activities walking, running and eating.
The data sampling frequency is over 10 Hz for proper accuracy.
We then classify the activities using Support Vector Machine.
For the validated test accuracy, we use ‘K-fold cross-validation technique’.
